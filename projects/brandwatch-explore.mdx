abstract:
introduction: I was the senior developer on the Reach feature team for a new Greenfield app. We re-used the backend APIs from the legacy web app and built a new frontend in React. Reach displays an interactive table and date-scrubber to explore a query, and the sidebar shows social media mentions for the query updated in real-time from your selection.
